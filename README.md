# Multi-Signature Wallet

A Multi-Signature Wallet is wallet where you need control over multiple private keys to spend from that wallet. The idea with multi-sig wallets is that multiple people can cooperatively control the funds in the wallet. Alternatively, the wallet can require approval from multiple devices owned by the same person, i.e., a form of second-factor authentication.
